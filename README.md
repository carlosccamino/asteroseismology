# Asteroseismology
Repository to have asteroseismology useful functions and constants

## Modules

### constants

This module consists of a class that constains physical constants, such as the stellar parameters of the sun
in international units. Additionally, asteroseismologic related values are added, e.g. solar large separation.

### freq_analysis

This module contains frequency analysis to identify harmonics, aliased functions and conversion of units (c/d->microHz) function.
